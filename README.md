# coding_challenge
This is a coding challenge to build an Ansible-Playbook that goes inside APIC and build the whole topology (Tenant, VRF, Bridge-Domains, EPGs, Application Profiles, Contracts, etc.) and some extra features.

Note: screen-shots are attached in Issues section.


Phase I
Generated by "standard.yml" playbook

Topology: -
-	One tenant (am_tn)
-	One application profile (am_ap)
-	3 bridge domains
•	Web_server
•	App_Server
•	Data_Base

-	All running inside one VRF

 
-	Every bridge domain is associated with a subnet

-	Three EPGs 
-	Every EPG is associated with a bridge domain
-	Two contracts were created: 


  Cont_1: filters traffic between Web_servre & App_Server

  Cont_2: filters traffic between App_Server & Data_Base
 
Phase II

Generated by "mit_Bonus.yml" playbook.

Create new tenant dedicated for this new topology.
Create a “L3-out” in order to advertise Web_Server subnet to the outside world
Create External EPG (EPG-4) and associate it with L3-out.
Create contract (cont_3) between EPG_4 and the Web_server (EPG_1) in order to advertise Web_server subnet to the outside world.
